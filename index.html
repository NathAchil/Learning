                    <h3>Origins:</h3>
                    <p>This website is a product of the personal project. The personal project is a project grade by Suncoast Highschool assigned to the AP Government class. And this project I had miserably failed at, if you could guess at the dismal state of this website.</p>

                <li>
                    <h3>Failures:</h3>
                    <p>The failures of this is procrastination, an extreme form of it. I imagine that, for most, the reason that would come to mind as to why  this would probably simply be laziness.  </p>
