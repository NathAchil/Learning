                    <h3>What is Studying?</h3>
                    <p>Studying is to take time reviewing and knowing certain things.</p>

                    <h3>Why study?</h3>
                    <p>You might be a student that didn't need to study for quizzes, tests and other types of grades but there will come a time in the future where thinking like this would be disadvantageous. When your knowledge of material becomes more thorough, more rigorous, and more difficult. Studying helps to make you remember material and apply them in certain situations. Also helps with boosting your grade.</p>

                <li>
                    <h3>Why question how to study?</h3>
                    <p>There are many ways to study. But there are more efficient, easier, and maybe even more interesting, ways to study. Simply reading the material may be enough, but if you want to truly recall as much of the material as you can, which might be necessary in the future, you would need </p>

                    <h3>Origins:</h3>
                    <p>This website is a product of the personal project. The personal project is a project grade by Suncoast Highschool assigned to the AP Government class. And this project I had miserably failed at, if you could guess at the dismal state of this website. There isn't even a favicon or any images! Or any data. Or actual cited sources. That's like, a super important thing.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Failures:</h3>
                    <p>The failures of this is procrastination, an extreme form of it. I imagine that, for most, the reason that would come to mind as to why  this would probably simply be laziness. In my opinion, my failure erupted from a blunder in mindset and incorrect motivation. I had picked website coding about how to learn because I thought it would be fun. To some, it might be horrendously boring to imagine such a thing. Imagine all the research I'd have to read, the code I'd have to create. But to me, such a thing isn't so bad, I may even call it fun to research and to create the code. For me, it's a question and/or puzzle to solve. Sometimes its boring, sometimes its hard. But there are times where it offers me an odd sense of calm when I do this type of work. So if I claim that I would have fun doing this, why did I not do it?
                        <br><br>    
                    It is a little embarrassing to admit this, but I feel that I had procrastinated more of a dread of the work. "What if I fail at it?" "What if I suck?" "What if my personal project looks crap compared to others?" It's said that the one often meets their fate on their way to avoid it. In a sense, I tried to avoid this fate, by simply not thinking about it. Look where it got me, a bad personal project with a bad grade. I suppose my failure was more that I should have focused on the task and not the possible failure.</p>
