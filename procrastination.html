        <h2>What is procrastination?</h2>
        <p><img id="can" src="images/kickTheCan.jpg">
        Procrastination is delaying upon some work to do it later. Many times, we often know that this is a bad thing, but we still do it. When faced with this problem, we should first determine the causes, because the reasons for procrastination are plenty, and are diverse for all of us</p>
        
        <h2>Why do we procrastinate?</h2>
        <p>There are many different possible reasons for procrastination. One way to see procrastination is seeing it as the body's strategy. For example, a paper that's due in 9 weeks. You could spread the work out over 8 weeks to get an A. But the brain dislikes this, why not just work for 3 days straight 3 days before the deadline is due for a C? It saves energy and time. Procrastination could be seen as the body's strategy to save time and energy by relegating work to later.<br>
        The problem of procrastination is endemic to almost every human being. And the reasons for why would be almost as diverse. To solve your own procrastination requires an examination of oneself and to ask why do I procrastinate, and when you work towards those problems is how you get rid of procrastination.</p>
        
        <h2>Three <u>Possible</u> Reasons of Procrastination</h2>

                <h3>Avoidance Procrastination</h3>
                <p>You avoid the work because it scares you, or reminds you of other negative emotions. It's like avoiding Biology homework because it reminds you too much about what could happen if you get a bad grade on it, how it's so boring, how it's so difficult to understand, and other negatives. That isn't to say that fearing such things is idiotic.
                <br><br>
                In a way, it could be said that this type of procrastination is your body's version of protecting you. If it gives you unpleasant emotions? Probably dangerous, you should avoid it.
                <br><br>
                Then, what is the solution to this problem? Thoroughly question your own thinking, ponder on how you had reached a conclusion or acted the way you did.<br>
                I would have described a more thorough line of questioning, unfortunately, I have run out of time.

                <h3>Idealistic Procrastination</h3>
                <p>You avoid the work because you cannot do it perfectly or do it well enough. Why do the reading project if you're not gonna do well? Sometimes, you have procrastinated so much that at a point, there is no way that your work could be the quality you wish it to be by the time you are finished. At that point, it would be better to accept the loss, mourn it, and move on. </p>

            <li>
                <h3>Operational Procrastination</h3>
                <p>You avoid the work because you don't understand the work. If the work needed to be done is vague and undefined, your brain is less likely to tackle it,  because it has almost no idea what to do for it. A solution to this is to define the goals needed to be done, and think about the steps required to complete the work needed to be done. </p>

            <li>
                <h3>Other</h3>
                <p>Maybe your problem is a combination of these problems, or maybe your reasons for procrastination isn't on here. What's important to remember though is that there is a reason for your procrastination, and it is important to ponder on those reasons and attempt to solve them.</p>
