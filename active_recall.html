                Active recall is essentially testing yourself. It comes from 'actively recalling'. When reading text or memorizing material, you store information in your brain. The problem with this is while you stored the information in your brain, did you practice taking it out? It's like you shoved a bunch of books in your brain, but didn't bother organizing them, checking them out, or practice getting them. <br>
            </p>
        <h2>How to do active recall?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> <h3>Pre-test</h3>
                <p>Actually maybe don't do this one first<br>
                I know that it's confusing for me to say that, but, I've found that trying to do this step might be harmful.<br>
                Pre-testing is when you test yourself on the material you're learning before actually trying to learn it. The concept is that <br>your brain would get frustrated with getting answers wrong so your brain tries harder to remember the detail you misremembered.<br>
                The problem with this is actually getting the pre-test itself. How are you going to get it? Where do you get worksheets to answer?<br>I found that this step might be used more as a reason to procrastinate, if I can't even do step 1, then I won't do any work towards this goal at all.</p>

            </li>
            
            <li> <h3>Ask Yourself</h3>
                <p>This is a more practical method than the step from before.<br>
                This is essentially when viewing material or at any time, ask yourself what did I just learn? If there was a video explaining the mitochondria, then you stop and ask yourself, "what does the mitochondria do?" and answer that question (in your own words) and see if your answer was correct. This could be during a lecture, while reading materials, while watching a video, as you're writing notes, almost any time. </p>
            </li>
            
            <li> <h3>Mind map</h3>
                <p>Mind mapping is when you mark a general idea, and branch out from it to remember more ideas and knowledge. For example, if you were studying US History, what are the things you might need to recall about it? From US History branches out the American Revolution, the US Civil War, WW1, the Great Depression, WW2, the Cold War, the Vietnam War, etc. And then from those branches, branch out even more, like from the American Revolution, the Declaration of Independence, the Tea Taxes, the Boston Massacre, etc. Usually done on a piece of paper</p>
            </li>
            
            <li> <h3>Teach someone</h3>
            <p>Teaching someone can be very helpful in trying to remember the knowledge you need to have. When you teach someone, it's important to choose your words correctly. It could be said that this may just be a different form of asking yourself. It is forcing you to remember and rephrase your knowledge in a more easily understandable form. </p></li>
            
            
            <li> <h3>Flashcards</h3>
            <p>The digital kind of course. Not the physical kind of flash cards.<br>
                What I mean by flash cards is a method or system to have questions asked of you, you answer, and you check if you were correct or not.  
                </p></li>

        </ol>
        
    <h2>The Important thing is: QUIZ YOURSELF</h2>
        
        <h2>Why did I ask this question?</h2>
        <p>The biggest problem I had with this was applying it. In Biology for my 9th grade year, the workload and material required to know was much more than my other classes. Because of this, I had the idea of applying study methods. I did some research on YouTube, since videos are easier to understand than articles usually, and found out about a bunch of study methods. One YouTube channel suggested <a href="remnote.com">Remnote</a>, which for me was very helpful in putting in questions and having the app/website/idk-what-its-called ask me questions. (Note: I already knew that Quizlet exists, but for me, it was too slow, too laggy and had too many ads for me to use for my studying, Remnote has almost none of those and is easier for me to use)
        <br><br>
        The more difficult kinds of Flashcards are ones concerning mathematics and language arts. I found math difficult to the study for in the sense that I could not find an easy way to describe the math concepts I needed to remember into Remnote, although at the time, it may have been more of a reason to procrastinate rather than actually putting it into words.
