                Active recall is essentially testing yourself. It comes from 'actively recalling'. When reading text or memorizing material, you store information in your brain. The problem with this is while you stored the information in your brain, did you practice taking it out? It's like you shoved a bunch of books in your brain, but didn't bother organizing them, checking them out, or practice getting them. <br>

        <h2>How to do active recall?</h2>
        <p>Blablabla</p>
        
        <h2>Why did I ask this question?</h2>
        <p>The biggest problem I had with this was applying it. In Biology for my 9th grade year, the workload and material required to know was much more than my other classes. Because of this, I had the idea of applying study methods. I did some research on YouTube, since videos are easier to understand than articles usually, and found out about a bunch of study methods. One YouTube channel suggested <a href="remnote.com">Remnote</a>, which for me was very helpful in putting in questions and having the app/website/idk-what-its-called ask me questions. (Note: I already knew that Quizlet exists, but for me, it was too slow, too laggy and had too many ads for me to use for my studying, Remnote has almost none of those and is easier for me to use) </p>
